## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-imap-gmail-client.git
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```sh
go mod tidy
```

3. **Run the application:**
```sh
go run main.go
```

4. **Setting Up Gmail:**
    
    - This application is currently designed to work with Gmail only.
    - You must use an app password to connect to your Gmail account.
    - Follow these links for more information on setting up an app password:

        - [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833#:~:text=to%2520your%2520data.-,sign%2520in%2520with%2520app%2520passwords,-Tip%253A%2520App%2520Passwords)
    - Typically, once you set up 2-Step Verification, you can create an app password directly by visiting [this link](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).

5. **Using the Application:**
    
    - Save your credentials using your Gmail address and app password.
    - Once saved, you can input the desired date in the GUI to generate the text file.
    - You can add several accounts, and all email histories will be saved in one text file in the order they were added.
    - Ensure the text file is generated correctly.

## Note for Windows Users

The first compilation of Fyne on Windows can take up to 10 minutes, depending on your hardware. Subsequent builds will be much faster.
